Feedback Survey

You are receiving this survey because we have met over the past year, whether in-person, phone, or email, and I value your opinion. Could you complete this 5 minute anonymous survey to give me feedback on what I did right and what I could do better?

#Why did we meet?

Another entrepreneur suggested we meet
Another investor suggested we meet
A colleague at my fund introduced us
Your experience and background seemed interesting and valuable

#How prepared was I for the meeting?

Extremely ("you asked great questions that helped me think about my business")
More than most ("you understood my business before we started the pitch")
Somewhat ("you had some understanding of the business")
Not very ("you knew who introduced us, but that was it")
Not at all ("you had no idea who I was or what I was working on")

Was the meeting valuable for you?

Extremely ("you made creative and unique suggestions that I implemented")
More than most ("you helped me think through some critical concerns in a new way")

Better than most ("you responded with next steps or a decision clearer and faster than most")
Somewhat ("you followed up with next steps or further intros, but it took a long time")
Not at all ("you never followed up and didn't carry through with what you promised")

Did I communicate our investment decision clearly?

Not Applicable ("we met for feedback or advice rather than about investing")
Extremely ("even if I disagreed with the decision, you communicated with empathy and were clear why we were or were not moving forward")
More than most ("you were clearer and gave better feedback than most")
Somewhat ("you followed up and gave a reason, but I didn't understand it")
Not very ("you gave a very belated response and did not give a reason why")
Not at all ("you never responded or followed up")
