VC Feedback Survey

n 2011 I was impressed by Phin Barnes' [feedback survey](http://www.sneakerheadvc.com/2011/11/17/continuous-feedback-founder-response-sneakerheadvc-product/) in an effort to improve his own ["product"](http://www.sneakerheadvc.com/2011/07/05/vc-product-broken/), and stored it away in the back of my head as something to do in the future.

Last week I surveyed all of the entrepreneurs I've met over the past 2.5 years to see how I've done on my own "product". I used a lot of Phin's basic structure and added a couple wrinkles specific to me (good ideas deserve to be appropriated), and focused on the initial meeting product (not the VC support product), focusing types of things that matter in that context, including timeliness, preparedness, responsiveness, etc. The survey was completely anonymous.
